This is the code and report for the Navigation project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree (DRLND).

## Project Details
The project's goal is to train a smart agent that can collect as many yellow bananas in a square world while avoiding black bananas.

The state is a 37 dimensional composed of the agent's velocity and the observability of bananas along rays around the object.

The agent can choose any of four actions (forward, backward, left, right).

## Getting started

The code is simply executed by observing the instructions in the Jupyter notebook Navigation.ipynb. The notebook also explains how
to setup the python environment and get all pre-requisites.

## Instructions
Simply follow the instructions inside the Navigation.ipynb

## Sample output
The Navigation.html is a report showing the results obtained when solving the challenge using different DQN configurations.

## Final notes
The submitted code builds upon the baseline notebooks and python files provided by Udacity.
