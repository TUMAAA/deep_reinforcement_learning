This is the code and report for the Navigation project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree (DRLND).

## Project Details
The project's goal is to train a smart agent that can collect as many yellow bananas in a square world while avoiding black bananas.

The state is a 37 dimensional composed of the agent's velocity and the observability of bananas along rays around the object.

The agent can choose any of four actions (forward, backward, left, right).

## Getting started

Detailed instructions to get the environment properly set up with the right Python version and dependencies is provided in the Jupyter notebook Navigation.ipynb. 

## Instructions
Make sure to run the Jupyter Notebook server from the repository root. This way the needed packaged "module" can be imported.

To train the agent simply follow the instructions inside the Navigation.ipynb.

## Sample output
The Report.html is a report showing the results obtained when solving the challenge using different DQN configurations.

## Final notes
The submitted code builds upon the baseline notebooks and python files provided by Udacity.
